## Description 

Development Mode and Live Mode have been replaced with new data access levels, more flexibility and streamline integration when building and using your business app. Standard Access is granted automatically and permits access to data owned by your business. 

Advanced Access must be requested through App Review to access data owned by people outside your business. If you don't need any level of access to a permission or feature, you can remove it and it will be listed as No Access.

If you need permissions and features not listed, you can view more by removing your app from the business app type.
